## Folder Structure

- `/agentforce-assets-library`: Contains the Next.js frontend application.
- `/docs`: Contains documentation, API specifications, and user guides.

## Libraries and Frameworks

## Coding Standards

- Use semicolons at the end of each statement.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Use function based components in React/Next.js.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.

- Organize components and pages for clarity and maintainability.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Optimize images and assets using Next.js built-in features.
- Prefer server-side rendering only when necessary.
